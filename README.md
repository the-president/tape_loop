# what is this?

this is a project to get me back into the swing of C++ gui and audio programming which I haven't done in a long time. I've been listening to a lot of ambient music youtube channels like [amulets](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmEJe33zRVKIgcycKeBmzJA), and [hainbach](https://www.youtube.com/user/Hainbach101) who do a lot of stuff with tape loops. I don't own any tape players so I thought I'd do a computer program that let me use some of these kinds of compositional techniques without having to buy a bunch of tape machines.

# how do I build it?

This project includes a [meson](https://mesonbuild.com/) file which so far works for me using depenencies installed on osx via homebrew.
